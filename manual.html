<h1 id="-what-is-the-smartplanner-application"><strong>What</strong> is the SmartPlanner application</h1>
<p>The <code>SmartPlanner</code> application is intended to assist the user to organize and follow in an effective and scientific manner his learning or studying tasks, as well as his general or daily life tasks. <br>
The user can elaborate a schedule (a studying schedule, or simply a normal schedule for general tasks). <br>
The user can :</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a schedule, and follow its progress, statistics and other information</li>
<li>Commit to your schedule by running its assigned tasks</li>
<li>Add personal notes</li>
<li>Elaborate a summary, by aggregating the notes or write a summary from scratch.</li>
<li>Share notes, summaries or schedule statistics online with other users</li>
<li>Get real time online content from other users, based on your schedules tags or keywords</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 2 types of schedules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study schedules: for study, learning or reading tasks</li>
<li>Agenda schedules: general or daily life schedules (e.g. sport workout, personal tasks...etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>The main functions are illustrated below: <br></p>

<h1 id="-how-to-use-the-smartplanner"><strong>How</strong> to use the SmartPlanner</h1>
<h3 id="create-a-schedule">Create a schedule</h3>
<p>To create a schedule (or planning), you should provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>The schedule title (e.g. for study or reading schedules, the book title for example)</li>
<li>The desired start date of the schedule</li>
<li>The schedule time slots and their repeat mode</li>
<li>At least a tag representing the topic of the schedule (e.g. Economy, Literature, Arts...etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>And for study or reading schedules, the following info:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of pages of the book or the reading support (*)</li>
<li>The average reading time for a single page (*)</li>
</ul>
<p>(*) These parameters are used to have an approximation of the total required study time in the schedule.</p>
<p>Below is an illustration of the schedule creation form:</p>
<p><em>Schedule information wizard:</em> <br><br>
<img src="resources/images/new_schedule.png" width="150"></p>
<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Please add notifications to the schedule.</li>
<li>Please also ensure that the <strong>notifications are allowed</strong> on your device for the <code>SmartPlanner</code> application.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
