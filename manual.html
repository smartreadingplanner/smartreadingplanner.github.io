<h1 id="-what-is-the-smartplanner-application"><strong>What</strong> is the SmartPlanner application</h1>
<p>The <code>SmartPlanner</code> application is intended to assist the user to organize and follow in an effective and scientific manner his learning or studying tasks, as well as his general or daily life tasks.\
The user can elaborate a schedule (a studying schedule, or simply a normal schedule for general tasks). <br>
The user can :</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a schedule, and follow its progress, statistics and other information</li>
<li>Commit to your schedule by running its assigned tasks</li>
<li>Add personal notes</li>
<li>Elaborate a summary, by aggregating the notes or write a summary from scratch.</li>
<li>Share notes, summaries or schedule statistics online with other users</li>
<li>Get real time online content from other users, based on your schedules tags or keywords</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 2 types of schedules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study schedules: for study, learning or reading tasks</li>
<li>Agenda schedules: general or daily life schedules (e.g. sport workout, personal tasks...etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>The main functions are illustrated below: <br></p>

<h1 id="-how-to-use-the-smartplanner"><strong>How</strong> to use the SmartPlanner</h1>
<h3 id="create-a-schedule">Create a schedule</h3>
<p>To create a schedule (or planning), you should provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>The schedule title (e.g. for study or reading schedules, the book title for example)</li>
<li>The desired start date of the schedule</li>
<li>The schedule time slots and their repeat mode</li>
<li>At least a tag representing the topic of the schedule (e.g. Economy, Literature, Arts...etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>And for study or reading schedules, the following info:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of pages of the book or the reading support (*)</li>
<li>The average reading time for a single page (*)</li>
</ul>
<p>(*) These parameters are used to have an approximation of the total required study time in the schedule.</p>
<p>Below is an illustration of the schedule creation form:</p>
<p><em>Schedule information wizard:</em> <br><br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartreadingplanner/smartplanner/main/documentation/display/new_schedule.png" width="150"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get notified about the schedule coming tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please add notifications to the schedule.</li>
<li>Please also ensure that the <strong>notifications are allowed</strong> on your device for the <code>SmartPlanner</code> application.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Schedule task notification</em><br><br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartreadingplanner/smartplanner/main/documentation/display/schedule_notification.png" width="150"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The application will ask you to allow notifications when needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="schedules-view">Schedules view</h3>
<p>The schedules view contains the list of created schedules (Study and agenda (normal) schedules)
The list contains schedules headers with brief important information about the schedule (title, start date, repeat mode, tags...etc). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For study schedules, the application gives the user an approximation about the <strong><em>expected study end date</em></strong> of the schedule.<br>
For study schedules also, the study progress is indicated in the schedule header.</p>

<h3 id="archived-schedules-">Archived schedules:</h3>
<p>When the end time (schedule limit or the number of occurrences) of a schedule is expired, then the schedule is marked as expired.</p>
<p>Then the schedule is archived as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>For non repeat schedules, the schedule is archived after 1 day</li>
<li>For daily schedules, the schedule is archived after 3 days</li>
<li>For weekly schedules, the schedule is archived after 7 days</li>
<li>For monthly and yearly schedules, the schedule is archived after 30 days</li>
</ul>
<p>Finished schedule are also archived as well.</p>
<h3 id="schedule-details-and-statistics">Schedule details and statistics</h3>
<p>The schedule details view contains the following information :</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Accomplished time</code>: the time that was consumed during the schedule runs. For study schedules, if the schedule is restarted, ths achieved time is reset to <code>0</code> and a new achievement is added.</li>
<li><code>Runs</code>: The number of times the schedule was run (a run is triggered using the <code>Run Task</code> in the schedule details view.</li>
<li><code>Notes</code>: How many notes were creaated in the schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>For study schedules, the statistics contains also the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Progress</code>: The study progress, or percentage of the study accomplishment (based on the achieved time and the calculated reading time)</li>
<li><code>Accomplishments</code>: How many times the schedule was finished and restarted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The schedule details contains also the schedule run statistics, the schedule notes, and eventual achievements. As well as schedule timeslots, repeat mode details and notifications</p>

<li>private sharing: the content is shared privately within given groups. Only those groups members have access to this content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a given content is shared online, you can update or delete it on the cloud.</p>
<h4 id="sharing-notes-and-summaries">Sharing notes and summaries</h4>
<p>In the notes view, and summary view, you have the menu to share the content (note or summary) on the cloud. Below is an illustration example for sharing a note online.</p>
